# Group Project: UnBore ME!

This Coding Bootcamp group project is called, "UnBore Me". UnBore Me is a website which searches thousands of events in a given area, ranging from festivals to concerts. UnBore Me is for anyone who is bored and wants to know what events are happening in their area.

A user simply specifies an event category, location and radius and UnBore Me will populate with event cards for the given place and category. Each event card holds broad event information and provides buttons for a Google Map view of the event, Facebook sharing and detailed event information.


#Logistics

- UnBore Me uses two API's, one for Google Maps and one for events from Eventful.
- Event cards are dynamically built and inserted using Javascript.
- Google maps are displayed in modals and re-initialized with every map button click.
- Firebase is used to track which is the top searched category.
- Front-end is styled with Zurb Foundation and custom CSS.
